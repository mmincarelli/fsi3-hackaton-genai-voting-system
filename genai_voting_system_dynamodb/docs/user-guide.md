## üìä Scoring Methodology

### Vote Calculation

2. **Judge Percentage**: (Yes votes / Total criteria) √ó 100
3. **Team Score**: Average of all judge percentages
4. **Ranking**: Teams sorted by total score descending

### Example Calculation
**Team A evaluated by 2 judges on 7 criteria:**
- Judge 1: 5 Yes votes = 71.4%
- Judge 2: 6 Yes votes = 85.7%
- **Final Score**: (71.4% + 85.7%) √∑ 2 = 78.6%
